Daniel was stuck in Helen C White on Friday, doing his CS Homework.
He had been working for hours, but his p2 BST insert would simply not function. 
He became incredibly frustrated and started walking around the library.
He eventually ran a full marathon in the library because of stress.
Daniel would not drop out of college, however. 
He ended up graduating and having an awesome time.

Well, it was not just awesome. He received $5000k salary every year just 2 
years after graduation, which was the highest salary among all the 2023ers 
of his college. Besides money, he was also successful academically. He created 
the most powerful AI in the world.

Daniel was stuck in Helen C White on Friday, doing his CS Homework.
He had been working for hours, but his p2 BST insert would simply not function. 
He became incredibly frustrated and started walking around the library.
He eventually ran a full marathon in the library because of stress.
Daniel would not drop out of college, however. 
He ended up graduating and having an awesome time.
